‘For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.’ John 3v16

‘For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.’ Romans 3v23

### God’s Word states that sin must be paid for.

‘For the wages of sin is death...’ Romans 6v23

### The Good News is that Christ died to pay for our sins.

‘But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.’ Romans 5v8

‘...Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried,
and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.’ I Corinthians 15v3-4
