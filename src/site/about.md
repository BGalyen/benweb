## Testimony of Benjamin Galyen

### *Salvation*

</center>

I was born in Newton, Illinois, the last of seven children. Our family moved to Tennessee when I was three years old. We joined Buffalo Ridge Baptist Church led by Pastor Gene Lasley.

I do not remember much of my life in those early years.  I do know that being raised in a Christian home and attending a good church did not save me.

One night in late October, when I was seven years old, as Pastor Lasley was preaching, God was speaking to my heart.  After the service, when we arrived back at our van, I told my mother that I wanted to be saved from my sins.

She explained to me what it means to be saved.<br>Romans 3:23 “For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.”

I knew I did wrong things and was a sinner,but she assured me that God loved me.<br>John 3:16, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish but have everlasting life.”  

However sin must be paid for.<br>“For the wages of sin is death...”  Romans 6:23a

Jesus Christ died on the cross the price  and paid the price for my sins.<br>“For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures: And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.”   Corinthians 15:3-4

“For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourself: it is a gift of God. Not of works, lest any man should boast.”  Ephesians  2:8-9

Finally, I must personally by faith accept Jesus as my Savior.<br>“That if thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the grave, thou shalt be saved”  Romans 10:9

 In our van that night, I prayed and asked Jesus Christ to be my Savior.<br>“For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.” Romans 10:13

### *Preparation*

</center>

As I grew into a teen, God blessed me with a youth leader who encouraged me to give my all to Christ.  In my senior year, Bob Mann introduced me to The Crown College of the Bible. God led me to study there, graduating in 2013 with a Bachelor Degree in Youth Ministries. In my senior year at Crown, God gave me an opportunity to study in England and work with church planters of the Crown Christian Heritage Trust.

After graduation, I served on staff at Buffalo Ridge Baptist Church as Caretaker. In addition I ministered as a bus captain, in children's ministries, as a camp counselor, on youth trips, and  in weekly high school Bible Clubs. God used this time of “unconscious preparation” to teach me many skills, I could need as a church planting missionary in the United Kingdom.

### *Experience*

</center>

In 2018, I returned to the United Kingdom and to help the missionaries there. I planned to stay 6 months to a year. I went in faith, supported partially by my home church, Buffalo Ridge and my own personal funds.

God gave me many opportunities to help and learn new skills. Besides teaching Sunday School and occasionally preaching, I taught a Handy Man's class to college students and taught English classes. Helping with the church plants, I worked on buses, visitations, Holiday Bible Clubs, youth rallies, weekly kid's programs, camp counseling, and audio visual productions. There were also much grounds work to do such as mowing, landscaping, tree cutting, gardening, and buildings' upkeep. In addition, I helped with computer technology, research, and even helped with grocery shopping to feed college students.

I experience firsthand many things involved in church planting in the United Kingdom.

Six months to a year quickly turned into two years. Unfortunately due to visa regulations, I could only stay 2 years,  I had to returned to the United States in August of 2020.

### *Call*

</center>

While in England, God made it very clear to me that He wanted me to continue ministering with Crown Christian Heritage Trust. This is a group of missionaries planting New Testament Churches in the United Kingdom.

With the call of God, the blessings from my home church, and the encouragement from the team in the UK, I plan to raise support, return to the UK, and spend my life furthering the Gospel of Christ in the United Kingdom.

## ***Statement Of Faith (What I Believe)***

### *The Scriptures*

</center>

The basis of what I believe about God and man comes from the Bible, the Word of God. I believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the Bible, “as it is in truth, the Word of God...” (I Thessalonians 2:13). I believe in verbal, plenary inspiration and God's preservation of His pure words to every generation (II Timothy 3:16, Psalms 12:6-8). I believe that the Scriptures are inerrant, infallible, and God-breathed. The Authorised Version of the Bible is the only English version I study and use. Unlike man-made creeds that are fallible, the Bible is my sole and final authority for faith and practice.

<center>

### *The Godhead*

</center>

There is one true and living God. He has graciously revealed Himself to us through His Word. I believe in one Triune God, eternally existing in three persons--Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, co-eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory, and having the same attributes and perfections (Deuteronomy 6:4; II Corinthians 13:14). I believe that God created the entire universe in six literal, twenty-four-hour days (Genesis 1:1-27).

<center>

### The Person & Work of Christ

</center>

Jesus Christ is the Saviour through Whom we may have peace with God. I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man, without ceasing to be God, having been conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary, in order that He might reveal God and redeem sinful men (John 1:1-2, 14; Luke 1:35; Isaiah 9:6; 7:14; Philippians 2:5-8; Galatians 4:4-5). I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ accomplished our redemption through His finished work on the cross as a representative, vicarious, substitutionary sacrifice; and that our justification is made sure by His literal, physical resurrection from the dead (Romans 3:24-25; I Peter 2:24; Ephesians 1:7; I Peter 1:3-5). I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ was raised bodily and that He ascended to Heaven, and is now exalted at the right hand of God, where, as our High Priest, He fulfills the ministry of Representative, Intercessor, and Advocate (Acts 1:9-10; Hebrews 9:24, 7:25; Romans 8:34; I John 2:1-2)

<center>

### The Person & Work of the Holy Spirit

</center>

I believe that the Holy Spirit is the Person who reproves the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; and that He is the Supernatural Agent in regeneration, indwelling all believers and sealing them unto the day of redemption (John 16:8-11; II Corinthians 3:6; Romans 8:9; Ephesians 1:13-14). I believe that the temporary sign gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as speaking in tongues and the gift of healing, were used to attest to the veracity of the apostles and as the New Testament was completed, those gifts are no longer necessary to understand God’s revelation to believers. I believe that speaking in tongues was never the common or necessary sign of the baptism or filling of the Holy Spirit and that ultimate deliverance of the body from sickness or death awaits the consummation of our salvation in the resurrection, though God frequently chooses to answer the prayer of believers for physical healing. (II Corinthians 12:12; I Corinthians 13:8; Hebrews 2:3-4; Mark 16:17-20; I Corinthians 1:22, 14:21-22).

<center>

### Satan

</center>

I believe in the reality of the person of Satan and that he and the fallen angels wage a spiritual warfare against the plan and purposes of God (John 13:2; Acts 5:3; Ephesians 6:11-12). I believe that Satan is a created angelic being who rebelled and who tempted man to join him in rebellion against God (Isaiah 14:12-17; Ezekiel 28:11-19; Genesis 3:1-5). Ibelieve his power is supernatural, yet limited; and that he cannot act without the permission of God (Job 1:6-12; I John 4:4). Satan’s eternal end is everlasting torment in the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:10).

<center>

### Man

</center>

I believe that man was created in the image and likeness of God, but that in Adam's sin the race fell, inherited a sinful nature, and became alienated from God; and therefore man is entirely depraved, and, of himself, utterly unable to remedy his lost condition (Genesis 1:26-27; Romans 3:22-23; Ephesians 2:1-3, 12). The uniqueness of human personality is evident in that God created man in His own image and is mindful of him, and in that Christ died for man; therefore every individual, though fallen, possesses human dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian love. (Psalm 8:4-9; Colossians 3:9-11).

<center>

### The Way of Salvation

</center>

I believe that the clear message of salvation is “repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ” (Acts 20:21). We believe that salvation is "by grace" alone through “faith alone.” I believe that Jesus Christ died in our place and that man is justified “by faith” alone in Christ’s finished work and are accounted righteous before God only through the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. (Ephesians 2:8-10; John 1:12; I Peter 1:18-19) . I believe that all the redeemed, once genuinely converted are kept by God's power and are thus the present possessors of eternal life (John 6:37-40, 10:27-30; Romans 8:1, 38-39; I Corinthians 1:4-8; I Peter 1:4-5; Jude 1, 2).

<center>

### The Church

</center>

I believe that the New Testament church is a local assembly of baptized believers who have voluntarily joined themselves together to worship the Lord, obey the ordinances and carry out the Great Commission. The Lord is doing His work in this world through local churches. The establishment and continuance of local churches is clearly taught and defined in the New Testament Scriptures (Acts 14:27; 20:17, 28-32; I Timothy 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-11). I believe in the autonomy of the local church free of any external authority or control. Christ is the only Head of the church (Acts 13:1-4, 15:19-31, 20:28; Romans 16:1, 4; I Corinthians 3:9,16; 5:4-7,13; I Peter 5:1-4). I recognize the ordinances of baptism by immersion in water and the Lord's Supper as a Scriptural means of testimony for local churches in this age (Matthew. 28:19-20; Acts 2:41-42, 18:18; I Corinthians 11:23-26).

<center>

### Biblical Separation

</center>

I believe that all the saved should live in such a manner as not to bring reproach upon their Saviour and Lord; and, that separation from all religious apostasy, all sinful pleasures, practices and associations is commanded of God (II Timothy 3:1-5; Romans 12:1, 2, 14:13; I John 2:15-17; II John 9-11; II Corinthians 6:14-7:1).

<center>

### The Return of Christ

</center>

I believe the "Blessed Hope" of our Lord's return is literal, personal, visible and imminent. My belief is that Christ may return at any moment and this truth purifies our daily walk in this world. I hold that Jesus Christ promised to return to earth and will come again bodily to fullfill his word. (I Thessalonians 4:13-18; Titus 2:13; I Thessalonians 1:10; Revelation 3:10; Zechariah 14:4-11; Revelation 19:11-16, 20:1-6; Psalm 89:3-4).

<center>

### Our Eternal State

</center>

I believe in the bodily resurrection of all men, the saved to eternal life, and the unsaved to judgment and everlasting punishment (Matthew 25:46; John 5:28, 29, 11:25-26; Revelation 20:5-6, 12-13).  I believe that the souls of the redeemed are, at death, absent from the body and present with the Lord, where in conscious bliss they await the first resurrection, when spirit, soul, and body are reunited to be glorified forever with the Lord (Luke 23:43; Revelation 20:4-6; II Corinthians 5:8; Philippians 1:23, 3:21; I Thessalonians 4:16-17).   We believe that the souls of unbelievers remain, after death, in conscious misery until the second resurrection, when with soul and body reunited they shall appear at the Judgment, and shall be cast into the Lake of Fire, not to be annihilated, but to suffer everlasting, conscious punishment (Luke 16:19-26; Matthew 25:41-46; II Thessalonians 1:7-9; Jude 6-7; Mark 9:43-48; Revelation 20:11-15).
